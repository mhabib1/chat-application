This is a Chat application where users can have peer 2 peer chats.

In this application I will be using React to create Chat application.
As I go further I will link the stuffs that I am using to create this project.

Created new folder called "application" where the chat application will be installed.
To create the react App I have used the following command: create-react-app ./

After creating the react application, delete the default src files, created new application.

npm i @ant-design/icons >> To install default icons.
npm react-chat-engine >> To install the chat engine.

Rectified the App.js file, by adding the proper imports
Created component folder that will include the ChatFeed.jsx that allows us to modified the ChatFeed components. Here goes another commit.
